  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a Software Developer with many years of experience. At the moment I am
    diving deep into Typescript, React, Go and Elixir, and I love getting my
    hands dirty in coding puzzles. But I have experience in a lot of other
    languages and technologies like Rust, Dart, Python and PHP. I already did a
    lot in my live, from being a banker, playing music on tour, jumping out of
    planes, being a music composer, to being a freelance web developer, and
    designing t-shirts.
