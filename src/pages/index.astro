      <h1>Hi people</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Developer with many years of experience. At the moment I am diving deep into Typescript, React,
        Rust and Elixir, and I love getting my hands dirty in coding puzzles (tech interviewers better be prepared ðŸ¤£).
        But I have experience in a lot of other languages and technologies like Go, Dart, Python and PHP. I already did
        a lot in my live, from being a banker, playing music on tour, jumping out of planes, being a music composer, to
        being a freelance web developer, and designing t-shirts.
      </p>
