  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a seasoned software developer with a passion for coding puzzles and a love for analog photography. Currently
    working at Frontify, I focus on TypeScript, React, Go, and Elixir, but I have experience in many other languages and
    technologies such as Rust, Dart, Python, and PHP. In my past life, I've worked in various industries, from banking
    to music composition, and I've even jumped out of planes! As a freelance web developer, I've created websites and
    developed games and created unique t-shirt designs.
