  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a Software Developer with many years of experience. At the moment I am diving deep into Typescript, React, HTMX
    and Go, and and I love getting my hands dirty in coding puzzles. But I have experience in a lot of other languages
    and technologies like Rust, Dart, Python, Elixir and PHP. I already did a lot in my life, from being a banker,
    playing music on tour, jumping out of planes, being a music composer, to being a freelance web developer, and
    designing t-shirts.
